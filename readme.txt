Description:
    A simple Godmode script for GTA:IV, to be used with the .Net Scripthook by HazardX.
    
More info:
    This is my first published mod for GTA:IV. The word 'mod' actually implies too much, it's just a simple script. Back when I wrote this I didn't code very nicely. Using multiple files? WHAT? Why? It all fits into one file, right? ;)
    
    Also, the code itself isn't very clean... But I knew how to use comments! Haha.
    
Compiling:
    Not needed, but if you really have to: grab "ScriptHookDotNet.dll" here: http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=392325 and have some fun.
